# Azure Devops Examples

This repository is designed to go with the various blogs on my blog [sethreid.co.nz](https://sethreid.co.nz) that show 
how to create builds using [Azure Devop's](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines/) new YAML based build pipeline configurations.

Included are:

- React - Blog WIP
- Angular - Blog WIP
- Vue - Blog WIP
- Dotnet Core - Blog WIP

## What is in the repository?

The repo contains base projects created with each framework's command line project generation tools and then a YAML file for each of them. They are all well documented on what is happening and can be found here:

- React - [react-pipeline.yml](./react-pipeline.yml)
- Angular - [angular-pipeline.yml](./angular-pipeline.yml)
- Vue - [vue-pipeline.yml](./vue-pipeline.yml)
- Dotnet Core - [dotnet-pipeline.yml](./react-pipeline.yml)
